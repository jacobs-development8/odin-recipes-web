    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>
        Here's a delicious, foolproof 'Pannekoek' recipe straight from the kitchen of my late and great granny Julia! This precious heirloom must have churned out gazillions of cinnamon sugar pancakes by now. And it's still going strong!
        It's your quintessential 'church bazaar' pancake batter, designed for the quick and effortless production of soft (never tough!) pancakes that gracefully flip without tearing or sticking.
